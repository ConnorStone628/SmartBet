This directory shall contain all code needed to interact with the database.
By importing a Database object you should have the ability to read from
and write to the database depending on the various settings. This database
will hold all information which has been scraped from various websites.The
database must also be able to maintain itself in the most automated way
possible. It should be able to spot missing elements and correct them where
possible, then notify the user where it cannot be corrected.
