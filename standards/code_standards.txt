description: Lists and explains the standards to use when writing code
for this project.

# How the standards are applied
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is expected that during development, changes will be made to your
code frequently. It would be unreasonable to expect these standards
to be applied at all times. The standards below are to represent the
state that finished code should be in. Any code to be merged with
the main branch will follow these basic outlines.

Ambiguous cases are bound to arise. Where these outlines are not
explicit, try to follow PEP 8 which is the general standard for
python. The PEP 8 rules will not be strictly enforced on merges.
If PEP 8 does not resolve your issue and you believe that it has an
impact on the readability of the code contact Connor Stone or
Mathiew Taylor. 

# Major section headings
################################################################################
All major sections begin with 80 characters in a line; as shown above.
The characters are to be the standard comment characters for the file.
the standard comment charachter for each type is:
python: %
.txt: #
C++: //

A title at the top of the section is prefered, but not neccessary. If
there is a title, it should be capetalized as a sentence. Major
sections represent groups of related functions or deffinitions, there
should be very few in a given file. 

# Minor section headings
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Minor sections begin with the comment character and have a row of "-"
characters until the width is 80. examples of minor sections are:
functions, classes, and class methods. A title at the top is prefered
but not necessary. If there is a title, it should be capetalized as a
sentence.

# Commenting
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments should be placed immediately above the line of code they
reference. Comments at the end of a line should be used only for
extremely brief statements. There should be a single space between
the comment character and the statement (ie "# my comment").

Comments should be above any loop/group of loops, function, class,
or block of code with a single purpose. A user should be able to
read only the comments and understand what the code does. However,
the comments do not need to explain to how the code accomplishes its
task. Except for specific cases where the process is of primary interest.

# White space
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Major and minor sections always have 1 or 2 blank lines above
them. Functions and classes have a blank line after their
definition. The line with "return" in it at the end of a function
should have a space above it. Loops have a blank line above and below
unless nested. If statements do not need a blank line above them.
variable declarations should have a blank line above and below them,
when doing multiple declarations they should come in a block with the
blank line above and below. Comments do not count as white space.

# Header
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The beginning of every file should start as this one, with lines of
80 characters of the comment character for the type of file above
and below the statement. It should include a description of the
purpose of the code found inside, a list of contributors, and a date
of first creation. The description should be brief, just an overview.
The list of contributors includes everyone who has written in the
file. The date should be in day-month-year order, formatted as: dd-mm-yyyy

# Variables
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All variables are to be exceptionally descriptive. Up to 25 characters
for a single variable is acceptable. Past that should only be for
especially tricky concepts, which may be better suited with abbreviation
and a comment above explaining it. The variables should be written in
all lower case, with "_" seperating ALL words. Yes, everything in lower
case, this includes acronyms like "nhl", do not write "NHL". Examples
include:
this_is_a_long_variable
shorter_variable
brief

Words in the variables should not be shortened, for example one
cannot turn "variable" into "var" or "v". Acronyms should be used
when they are the common way of refering to something, for example: "nhl",
"nfl", and "mlb" for "National Hockey League", "National Football League",
and "Major League Baseball" respectively.

# Line length
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lines should not in general exceede 80 characters. Any line which does go
past this will likely need a comment above it to explain what is happening.
In python the nesting/indenting scheme can lead to artifically long lines,
in these cases it is not an issue to pass 80 characters as long as the line
length is kept within reasonable bounds. Function and class definitions do
not need to fit line length requirements.

# Output
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All functions with print statments should have a verbosity parameter to
turn off all output. This is implimented as:
print "hello world"
to
if verbose: print "hello world"

In the future all output will be directed to logs, but this is currently
not used. Output is considered desireable and should be very explicit
about what is happeneing at any stage of the run which may crash. The
output should not, however, include large amounts of data which would
flood the output screen, status updates are preferable.

# Functions
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All functions must have a comment above them which specifies the expected
input and the type for that input, also a line describing the type of
information that will be returned. Any function intended for internal
purposes only should begin with a "_". The name of the function should
be in camel case, for example: _MyInternalFunction. The name of the
function should be descriptive in a similar manner to variables.
The arguments for a function should be treated like variables, in terms
of how descriptive they are.

# Classes
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Classes should be treated in the same way as functions.

# Example Code
################################################################################

# This is an example function to do a thing
# variable_one: example first variable (list)
# variable_two: example second variable (double)
# variable_with_default: example variable with a default value (str)
# returns: a count of the number of variable_one items
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
def _MyFunction(variable_one, variable_two, variable_with_default = default_value):

    # Declaring variables
    thing_one = 0
    thing_two = 1.0
    thing_three = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    # Check for items from the input list
    for item in variable_one:
    	thing_one += 1 # Count
	if item in thing_three:
	   print thing_two

    # Notify user of a condition
    if variable_two == thing_two:
        print "something happened"

    # Notify the user of the value of this variable
    print variable_with_default

    return thing_one
